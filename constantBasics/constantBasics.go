	// WHEN NOT TO USE IOTA
	// we basically use iota to generate some code for us // help in initializing enum/constant values
	// if the consntnat/ enum values will be persisted in db

	// db row : {City(name: "bengaluru", dir : 2)}
	// BENGALURU in SOUTH when db row read in code/app
	// lessay and later you added one more constant NORTH_EAST b/w NORTH and EAST //
	// e.g. compiled code after using iota NORTH 0, NORTH_EAST : 1, EAST : 2 SOUTH : 3 WEST: 4
	// db row : {City(name: "bengaluru", dir : 2)}
	// BENGALURU in EAST when db row read in code/app
	// ordering and number value will now change for all enums // deserialization of all values in db will now break :O  Nooooooooooo!
	// we actually wanted the mapping like NORTH 0, EAST : 1 SOUTH : 2 WEST: 3 NORTH_EAST : 5
	// and backward compatible consistent values  BENGALURU in SOUTH
